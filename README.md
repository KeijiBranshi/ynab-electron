# YNAB Desktop Wrapper

This is a really simple Electron wrapper around the new YNAB web app.

## To Use

Download the binaries from the releases page: 
https://github.com/dmackerman/ynab-electron/releases

## Building 
If you don't want to run the binaries, or feel like hacking around. You'll need `node` and `npm` installed.

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

## TODOs
- create a formal installer process, 
- add a way to install the YNAB enhancement suite (may not be possible)
- add icons
- Linux build
- disco
